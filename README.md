## 🌟 Features

### 🔒 Entity Protection
CritterGuard protects these creatures from theft and harm:

**Mountable Creatures:**
- Horses, Mules, Donkeys
- Zombie Horses, Skeleton Horses
- Llamas, Camels
- Happy Ghasts

**Companion Creatures:**
- Wolves, Cats, Parrots

**Protection Rules:**
- **Companions** (wolves, cats, parrots) can only be killed by their owners
- **Mounts** can be killed by anything, but only while being ridden

### 👥 Access Control System
Control who can use your mounts with two permission levels:

#### 🎫 Passenger Access
- **Applies to:** Multi-seat mounts only (camels, happy ghasts)
- **Allows:** Riding as a passenger when owner/full-access user is driving
- **Cannot:** Take control or board without driver present

#### 🎯 Full Access
- **Applies to:** All mounts
- **Allows:** Complete control of the mount
- **Includes:** Access to mount storage (chests on donkeys/llamas)

### 🔔 Notifications
Stay informed about your mounts! You'll be notified when someone with full access:
- Mounts your creature
- Dismounts your creature
- Lets your mount die while riding

*Toggle with: `/critter notifications [on/off]`*

### 🔄 Smart Seat Swapping
For multi-seat mounts, when the driver dismounts:
- Next person with full access automatically becomes driver
- If no one else has full access, everyone is dismounted
- Ensures uninterrupted journeys!

### 🎭 Disguise Saddles *(LibsDisguises Required)*
Transform your mount's appearance with special saddles!

**Setup:** Add lore to any saddle starting with `Disguise: ` followed by the mob type
**Example:** `Disguise: WOLF`

> [!NOTE]  
> Multi-seat disguised mounts will stack players on top of each other due to technical limitations.

## 🔧 Understanding Identifiers

The `<identifier>` parameter accepts:
1. **Creature's name** (from nametags)
2. **Creature's UUID**
3. **Index number** (from `/critter list`)

**Smart Matching:** Partial matches work! For a dog named "Fido", `/critter gps fi` works fine.

> [!WARNING]
> If multiple creatures match your partial input, the one with the lowest index number is selected.
